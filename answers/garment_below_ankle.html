  <h1>Ruling on Letting the Garment Hang Below the Ankles</h1>

  <p><strong>Question:</strong> Isbāl (letting the garment hang below the ankles) — how was it permitted for Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) but not permitted for us?</p>

  <p><strong>Answer:</strong> In the name of Allah, all praise is due to Allah, and may Peace and Blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ).</p>

  <p>Isbāl is haram for us and for Abu Bakr, but in the case of Abu Bakr he was skinny, and he had already raised his garment above his ankles. The Prophet ﷺ clarified that Abu Bakr’s case was not out of arrogance.</p>

  <h2>From the Sunnah:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Sahih al-Bukhari 5784:</strong><br>
      Abdullah ibn Umar reported:<br>
      <blockquote>
        The Prophet (ﷺ) said Allah will not look on the Day of Resurrection at the person who drags his garment (behind him) out of conceit. On that Abu Bakr said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! One side of my Izar hangs low if I do not take care of it." The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 'You are not one of those who do that out of conceit."
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sahih Muslim 106:</strong><br>
      Abu Dharr reported:<br>
      <blockquote>
        "Three are the persons with whom Allah would not speak on the Day of Resurrection: the bestower of gift who does not give anything but by laying obligation on him, the seller of goods who sells them by taking false oath and one who hangs low his lower garment.""
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion:</h2>

  <p>
    The prohibition of Isbāl (letting the garment hang below the ankles) is established in multiple authentic hadiths, particularly when it is done out of pride or arrogance. Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him) was not exempt from the ruling itself, but the Prophet ﷺ clarified that his situation was different—he was not doing so out of arrogance, and the slipping of his garment was unintentional due to his slim build. Therefore, the ruling remains applicable to all, and any intentional lowering of the garment below the ankles out of pride remains a serious matter in Islam. A believer should take this warning seriously and strive for humility in all aspects of appearance and behavior. And Allah knows best.  </p>
