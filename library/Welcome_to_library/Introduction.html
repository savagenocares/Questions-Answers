      In the name of God, Most Benificent, Most Merciful<br><br>
      Indeed, all praise is due to Allah; we praise Him, seek His help, seek His guidance, and seek His forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allah from the evils of ourselves and from the bad consequences of our deeds. Whoever Allah guides, there is none who can misguide him; and whoever He leaves astray, there is none who can guide him. Verily, the most truthful speech is the Book of Allah, and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him). The worst of matters are newly invented ones, and every newly invented matter is an innovation (bid‘ah), and every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Fire.
And prayers and peace be upon the one sent as a mercy to the worlds, Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him and his family and all his companions, and those who follow them with excellence until the Day of Judgment).
As for what follows:

Know, may Allah have mercy upon you, that the science of hadith is among the most noble and honorable of sciences. Allah has appointed, from the time of the Companions up until our time, scholars who dedicated themselves to the care of the Sunnah: preserving it in memory, compiling it in books, investigating it and its narrators — men and women — clarifying what is authentic from what is weak.
Among these scholars is Imam al-Nawawi — may Allah have mercy on him — regarding whom scholars, hadith experts, and jurists after him have agreed that he was a great imam, ascetic, devout, a jurist, and a hadith scholar. There is unanimous agreement regarding his eminence and virtue in knowledge. He authored numerous works, all of which Allah made beneficial for students of knowledge.
Among his works is the book that became famous among the people as “Al-Arba’in al-Nawawiyyah” (The Forty Nawawi Hadiths), attributed to its author Imam al-Nawawi, who is ascribed to the town of Nawa, a region near the Golan Heights from the areas of Damascus. He was raised there and then pursued his studies in Damascus, specifically at the Umayyad Mosque, and traveled to various lands seeking knowledge. Allah, the Exalted, benefited people through him and his writings.

The origin of his book, The Forty Nawawi Hadiths, as some scholars mention, lies in the fact that many scholars had compiled collections of forty hadiths — some on a single topic such as the virtues of knowledge, others on the virtues of cities, or on chains of narration, and so forth.
The reason for choosing the number forty is that there is a hadith, which some scholars have deemed weak, but which has been acted upon regarding virtuous deeds:
“Whoever preserves for my nation forty hadiths related to their religious matters, Allah will admit him into Paradise, or He will make him among the God-fearing.”
The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) thus promised a reward for the one who collects forty hadiths concerning matters of religion.
Even though the hadith is weak, many scholars have compiled collections of forty hadiths on various subjects.
The foundation of The Forty Nawawi Hadiths, as Ibn Rajab mentioned in the introduction to his commentary, is that Ibn al-Salah — one of the greatest hadith scholars in the Levant — once held a session in which he dictated some comprehensive sayings of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him). He dictated twenty-six hadiths during that gathering. Imam al-Nawawi — may Allah have mercy on him — then took those twenty-six and added to them to complete forty — more precisely, forty-two hadiths.
He selected hadiths that are considered fundamental principles in Islam.
Later, Ibn Rajab — may Allah have mercy on him — took those forty-two hadiths and added eight more to complete a total of fifty hadiths.

Some scholars said regarding them that they constitute a quarter of Islamic legislation, or a quarter of the religion, or a third of the religion.
There are general hadiths, as mentioned from Imam Ahmad — may Allah have mercy on him — that three hadiths revolve around the entire Shari’ah:
	•	The hadith of ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab: “Actions are only by intentions.”
	•	The hadith: “Every deed not based on our command is rejected.”
	•	And the hadith: “The lawful is clear, and the unlawful is clear, and between them are ambiguous matters. Whoever avoids the doubtful matters has safeguarded his religion and honor.”

Imam Ahmad said that all deeds are not accepted except with intentions, and that secondary deeds must conform to what the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) brought — and this is the second hadith.
As for the third hadith: deeds are either clearly lawful, clearly unlawful, or ambiguous between the two; and all rulings of Islamic jurisprudence fall into these three categories.
There is no fourth category.
“Whoever avoids the doubtful matters has safeguarded his religion and his honor.”
Imam Ahmad — may Allah have mercy on him — said that no legal ruling falls outside these three hadiths.

It is narrated from Abu Dawud — may Allah have mercy on him — that he said:
“I gathered four hundred thousand hadiths, and found that they revolve around four hadiths,” and Ibn Rajab mentioned them in his introduction.
Besides these, there are many hadiths that serve as general principles, stemming from the saying of the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him):
“I have been given concise speech (jawāmi‘ al-kalim).”
Indeed, he (peace and blessings be upon him) was given concise, comprehensive speech and wisdom — meaning he could convey broad, weighty meanings in just a few words.
For example, in the hadith:
“Every deed not based on our command is rejected.”
If you were to examine all human actions — in matters of purification, prayer, fasting, zakah, pilgrimage, etc. — and compare them against the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him):
If they conform to what is found therein, then excellent; otherwise, they are rejected.

This is affirmed by Allah’s saying:
{And whatever the Messenger gives you, take it; and whatever he forbids you from, refrain from it.} (Surah Al-Hashr, 59:7)

      بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم<br><br>
      

إن الحمد لله نحمده ونستعينه ونستهديه ونستغفره، ونعوذ بالله من شرور أنفسنا ومن سيئات أعمالنا، من يهده الله فهو المهتدي، ومن يضلل فلا هادي له، وإن أصدق الحديث كلام الله، وخير الهدي هدي محمد ﷺ، وإن شر الأمور محدثاتها، وإن كل محدثة بدعة، وكل بدعة ضلالة، وكل ضلالة في النار.
والصلاة والسلام على المبعوث رحمة للعالمين، محمد رسول الله صلى الله عليه وآله وصحبه أجمعين والتابعين لهم بإحسان إلى يوم الدين.
أما بعد:
اعلم رحمك أن علم الحديث من اجل العلوم واشرفه وقد قيض الله في هذا الأمر من العلماء من عهد الصحابة إلى يومنا من يعتني بالسنة ويحفظها في الصدور، ويضمها في الكتب، وينقب عنها وعن رواتها من الرجال والنساء، ويوضح الصحيح من السقيم.
ومن بين هؤلاء الامام النووي رحمه الله اتفق علماء والمحدثون والفقهاء من بعده: على أنه إمام جليل، زاهد ورع، فقيه محدث، وهو محل اتفاق على جلالته وفضله في العلم، وله مصنفات عديدة وكلها نفع الله بها طلبة العلم، وهذا الكتاب الذي اشتهر عند الناس بالأربعين النووية، نسبة إلى مؤلفه الإمام النووي، الذي ينسب إلى نَوى، وهي منطقة تتبع الجولان من أعمال دمشق، ونشأ بها، ثم تعلم في دمشق أي في الجامع الأموي، ورحل إلى عدة أقطار وتعلم، ونفع الله سبحانه وتعالى به وبمؤلفاته.
 وأصل كتابه هذا الأربعين النووية، يقول بعض العلماء: إن كثيراً من العلماء قد ألفوا في الأربعينيات، فمنهم من يجمع أربعين حديثاً في موضوع واحد، كفضائل العلم، ومنهم من يجمع في فضائل البلدان، أو في المسلسلات أو في غير ذلك.
وسبب التحديد بهذا العدد فقد ورد حديث ضعفه البعض، ولكنهم عملوا به في فضائل الأعمال: (من حفظ على أمتي أربعين حديثاً على أمتي من أمور الدين أدخله الله الجنة، أو جعله الله من المتقين) ، ورتب صلى الله عليه وسلم جزاءً على من جمع أربعين حديثاً من أمور الدين.
قالوا: وإن كان ضعيفاً إلا أن كثيراً من العلماء جمعوا أربعينات في مواضيع مختلفة ، وأصل الأربعين النووية كما ذكر ابن رجب في مقدمة شرحه: أن ابن الصلاح وهو من أجل علماء الحديث في الشام، جلس في يومٍ مجلساً ليملي أحاديث من جوامع كلمه عليه الصلاة والسلام، فأملى ستةً وعشرين حديثاً في مجلسه ذاك، فجاء النووي رحمه الله وأخذ هذه الستة والعشرين وأضاف إليها ما أكمل الأربعين، وبالتحديد اثنين وأربعين حديثاً، انتخب فيها الأحاديث الجامعة التي تعد كأصل أصيل في الإسلام , ثم جاء ابن رجب رحمه الله وأخذ الاثنين والأربعين وأضاف إليها ثمانية حتى كملت الخمسين حديثاً.
وبعضها يقول عنه بعض العلماء: ربع التشريع، أو ربع الدين، أو ثلث الدين، هناك أحاديث عامة كما جاء عن أحمد رحمه الله: أن ثلاثة أحاديث تدور عليها الشريعة كلها: حديث عمر بن الخطاب: (إنما الأعمال بالنيات) ، وحديث: (كل عمل ليس عليه أمرنا فهو رد) ، وحديث: (إن الحلال بيّن والحرام بيّن وبينهما أمور مشتبهات، فمن ترك المتشابهات فقد استبرأ لدينه وعرضه) .
ويقول أحمد لأن الأعمال كلها لا تقبل إلا بنياتها، والأعمال الفرعية لابد أن تكون مطابقة لما جاء به رسول الله صلى الله عليه وسلم، وهذا هو الحديث الثاني، والثالث: أن الأعمال منها ما هو بين حلال، ومنها ما هو بين حرام وبينهما المشتبهات، وجميع أحكام الفقه هكذا: إما حلال بين وإما حرام بين، وإما مشتبه بينهما، ليس هناك قسم رابع، (فمن ترك الشبهات استبرأ لدينه وعرضه) فيقول أحمد رحمه الله: لم يخرج حكم تشريعي عن هذه الأحاديث الثلاثة.
ويروون عن أبي داود رحمه الله أنه يقول: جمعت أربعمائة ألف حديث، ووجدتها تدور على أربعة أحاديث، وذكرها ابن رجب في مقدمته، إلى غير ذلك من الأحاديث التي تعتبر قواعد عامة، وأخذوا ذلك من قوله صلى الله عليه وسلم: (أوتيت جوامع الكلم) ، فهو صلى الله عليه وسلم أعطي جوامع الكلم والحكم؛ لأنه يجمع المعنى الكبير جداً في كلمتين، كما في هذا الحديث: (كل عمل ليس عليه أمرنا فهو رد) ، فلو جئت بجميع أعمال المكلفين في الطهارة أو الصلاة أو الصيام أو الزكاة أو الحج.
إلخ، فقسه على ما جاء في كتاب الله وسنة رسوله صلى الله عليه وسلم، إن كان موافقاً لما جاء فيها فبها ونعمت، وإلا فهو مردود، ويشهد له قوله سبحانه، {وَمَا آتَاكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانْتَهُوا} [الحشر:7] .
